Platypus Conquistador
=====================

Platypus Conquistador is a bioinformatic tool for the confirmation of the presence/absence of a specific taxon (or set of taxa) in environmental shotgun sequence reads. Platypus uses two reference databases: an interest database (containing sequences of interest) and an other database (containing all reference library sequences). Platypus uses these databases to generate plots showing the number of sequences that are closest to the sequences of interest - based on similarity - compared to the sequences in other.

To start using Platypus, please refer to the [installation notes](INSTALL.md); also check the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)
