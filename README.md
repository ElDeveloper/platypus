Platypus Conquistador is a bioinformatic command line tool for the confirmation of the presence/absence of a specific taxon (or set of taxa) in environmental shotgun sequence reads. Platypus uses two reference databases: an interest database (containing sequences of interest) and an other database (containing all reference library sequences). Platypus uses these databases to generate data showing the number of sequences to those that are closest to the sequences of interest, based on similarity, and their sequence match; this information is also provided for the rest (other) reference database.

To start using Platypus, please refer to the [installation notes](INSTALL.md); also check the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)
